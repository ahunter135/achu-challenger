    <p>15. COPYRIGHT; DESIGNATED AGENT FOR NOTIFICATION OF CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT.</p>
    <p>‍Datapult respects the intellectual property of others, and it asks its users to do the same.  Accordingly, it is Datapult’s policy to respond to a notice of alleged infringement that complies with U.S. Copyright Law, and in particular, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA" available at http://www.copyright.gov).
    </p>

    <p>Reporting intellectual property infringement is a serious matter with legal consequences. Any person who knowingly and materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing could be liable for damages pursuant to section 512(f) of the DMCA or similar laws in other jurisdictions or countries. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material available online infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the notice requirements below, your copyright notice may not be valid.</p>
    <p>Responses to claims of intellectual property infringement may include removing or disabling access to content or material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating yours or other’s rights to access and use the Properties.  You acknowledge that you may be liable for damages, including attorneys’ fees and costs, if you materially misrepresent that a work or activity is infringing your rights.</p>
    <p>If Datapult terminates or suspends a user’s access to or use of the Properties, Datapult will make a good-faith attempt (as warranted) to contact the person who posted the content so that they may make counter notification pursuant to applicable laws.  It is Datapult’s policy to document all notices of alleged infringement upon which Datapult decides to take action.  As with all legal notices, a copy of the notice may be sent to one or more third parties who may make such notice available to the public.  If you believe that one or more of your works have been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide a written notice of your claim of copyright infringement that is directed to Datapult’s designated agent as specified below along with the following information:</p>
 
    <ul>
      <li>A signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest that is allegedly infringed;</li>
      <li>A description, in reasonable detail (including any applicable URL address), of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works are involved, a representative list of the works that you allege are infringed.</li>
  <li>A description, in reasonable detail, of the infringed material and where such material is located on the Properties;</li>
  <li>Your physical address (where you can receive mail), telephone number, and e-mail address;</li>
  <li>Both of the following statements: “I hereby state that I have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (e.g., as a fair use)."; and “I hereby state that the information in this Notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that I am the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of the copyright or of an exclusive right under the copyright that is allegedly infringed."</li>
  <li>Designated Agent:  CEO, datapult Inc. 235-17 Industrial Parkway South, Aurora, Ontario, L4G 3V5; info@achuhealth.ca)</li>

  <p>16. REVIEWS.</p>
<p>
  Your reviews, testimonials, or other feedback concerning Datapult, the Properties, or other Datapult services will be deemed to include a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable and non-exclusive right and license to Datapult. Datapult, at its own discretion, may adopt, publish, reproduce, disseminate, transmit, distribute, copy, use, create derivative works from, and/or display (in whole or in part) your feedback worldwide in any known or later-developed media.
</p>
<p>17. ENFORCEMENT AND WAIVER.</p>
<p>Any breach of this Agreement, including, for example, violations or infringement of Datapult’s intellectual property rights, may cause significant injury to Datapult. Datapult aggressively defends its rights and will seek redress in both law and equity in the event of any breach, threatened or actual, of this Agreement. If the injury is irreparable or not quantifiable in monetary damages, Datapult would not have an adequate remedy at law and shall be entitled to a preliminary or permanent injunction, or other appropriate equitable relief, from a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Datapult’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Datapult. Except as expressly set forth herein, the exercise by either party of any remedies it may have will be without prejudice to its other remedies under the Agreement or otherwise.</p>
<p>18. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</p>
<p>‍This Agreement has been made in and will be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York regardless of conflict of laws principles.  You agree to personal jurisdiction and venue in the State of New York, New York County and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue.  You agree to waive your right to a trial by jury.</p>
<p>Any claim against Datapult must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is forever barred.  In any legal proceeding brought by Datapult, Datapult shall have the right to seek and be awarded all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs in addition to any other relief, at law or in equity, to which Datapult may be entitled.</p>
<p>We always wish to address disputes without resorting to legal action. Before filing a claim against Datapult, you agree to try to resolve your dispute with Datapult in good faith. If not resolution can be reached, either party may proceed to formal dispute resolution.</p>    
<p>Prior to filing a lawsuit, you and Datapult agree to resolve disputes through final and binding arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the New York, New York, your state of residence, or any other location we agree to.</p>
<p>Datapult may file a suit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of its products, services, or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.</p>
<p>You may not bring any claims as a plaintiff or member of a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, or case consolidations are not allowed under the Agreement.</p>
<p>‍19.</p>
<p>By clicking “I ACCEPT," you agree to the terms herein and become a party to this Agreement.  Either party may voluntarily terminate this Agreement without cause, but it shall terminate automatically if  you fail to comply with its terms and conditions.  Datapult may in its sole discretion terminate this Agreement with or without notice to you, and for any or no reason.  Upon termination of this Agreement, any and all right(s) to use the Properties shall immediately cease. Sections 2-4, 9-21 will survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>20. SEVERABILITY.</p>
<p>‍If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, or will be deemed superseded by one or more valid, enforceable provisions that closely match the intent of the original provision.  A provision that is held invalid, unenforceable, or that is subsequently superseded by one or more valid provisions will have no bearing on the remaining terms and conditions of the Agreement, which shall remain valid, binding, and fully enforceable.</p>
<p>21. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.</p>
<p>This Agreement does not form a joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and Datapult.  This Agreement and Datapult’s Privacy Policy found at http://www.achuhealth/privacy-policy.php represent the entire agreement between you and Datapult with respect to use of the Properties, and hereby supersedes any prior agreements between you and Datapult.</p>
<p>You may not assign, delegate, or transfer the rights or obligations under this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without Datapult’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Datapult may freely assign or transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.</p>
<p>Datapult may update and/or modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time, and may do so without advance notice to you. Each time you access the Properties, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by the Agreement in effect at the time of your access. Accordingly, please review the terms and conditions found at this location on a periodic basis.</p>
